# Git and GitHub

- Git and GitHub are not the same thing.
- Git is a version control system - you install and use this on your local workstation.
- Git allows you to create separate repositories -- 'repos' -- for each project or document set
- GitHub is a web service that hosts your repos. If you make your work public, then anyone can view and download your repo.
- Astrea has a private GitHub account so that we can use this to host and distribute the repos within Astrea.
- Host your public repos on GitHub for free, for instance mine is here: <https://github.com/jimpea>.
- Astrea has a corporate (private) account here: <https://github.com/Astrea-Bioseparations>, you should not have access to this unless you have an Astrea GitHub account
